# User Interviews:
### Research Protocol

The purpose of the user interviews are to uncover the factors that makes a player special in the eyes of a fan. I would like to focus more on hard-core NBA fans with a high basketball literacy, because I believe they have more in line with my target audience and will definitely have a more passionate opinion than casual fans. If done correctly, these interviews should help me identify further facets of Luka Doncic’s game to explore in my presentation. 

#### Target audience: 
Casual and serious NBA fans, individuals with a curiosity about the NBA

#### Identifying relevant individuals to interview:
To find individuals that reflect my target audience I will leverage my personal network. I will interview friends that I play basketball with (hardcore fans), as well as family members that have had a periphery interest in professional basketball (curious/casual fans).

#### Interview script and sections:
Background:
I would like to explore the potential for (and make an argument supporting) Luka Doncic’s status as a generationally unique NBA player. To dive into Luka’s potential and status, I would like to explore the factors that distinguish NBA players from each other in the eyes of fans.

How you view NBA players, and what makes them special:

Iterate over this as many times as you want:

4.	Who is your favorite player?

> a.	Gianis Ant..

5.	Why were they your favorite?

a.	Unique underdog story (coming up immigrant from Nigeria, living on street of Athens…) was aware before he was drafted
b.	Gets better every year, no one has seen anything like him (physical) 
c.	Raw passion and talent, 
d.	Breadth of fresh air from media raised superstars (humble)
i.	No deals on the side, just playing basketball

6.	Are you aware of any other players with similar attributes that you are drawn to?
a.	Another player with similarities is Kawaii (quiet, down to earth… lets his game speak… -> lost love with forcing his way out of SA…)
b.	Mitchel Robinson (used to joke that I liked long players… Bam… Physical characteristics – hes like an octopus on Defense…
i.	I LOVE LONG AND LENGTHY PLAYERS
7.	What sets them apart from similar players?
a.	His body changed so rapidly (started as a guard, but now is built like a “5”), its his expanding potential
8.	Is there anything else? -> .. Almost a rags to riches story…
9.	On the court vs. off the court? (On: 50, Off: 50) -> first 50 is on the court, second 50 is off the court, after your past a certain level, anything past that is off the court… LBJ and James Harden cant get to that status, gotta fill up a talent their before you can get to the aesthetic taste can be taken into consideration


10.	What draws you to different players? (do you believe in historic greatness, what makes you put the label of greatness on someone)
a.	Not interested in who is “the best”
b.	I think we are drawn to “the mythology” of the sport – ancient Greek heroes (achilles, alexander the great)… we look up to these people because they’ve done something that we’ve never seen before, not interesting to compare them, we just look at them in the pantheon…
c.	Something special about a player that can achieve something that has never been done before…
i.	Everyone can announce their presence in a unique way (on and off court)
d.	Pornography – you cant define it but you know it when you see it.
11.	Can you identify any single variable?

12.	What do you believe makes players “withstand the test of time”?
a.	See Above…
b.	Statistical outliers, at least top 5% in the league…
c.	Shoe deals and shoe sales…Magazine covers

The role of facts and feelings:

13.	Do you ever feel torn about “hating” a player and admiring their greatness?
a.	Alternative: Are there players you hate that are recognized as great? Are there players you think that are great that are not recognized as such?
b.	Yeah… constant balance of recognizing talent, but going against personal tastes… (influence by purely counting stats, winning…)
15.	What influences how you feel about a player?
a.	We got to this

16.	Do you believe in “intangible” factors that influence a players greatness?
a.	Yes – see on “seeing something you’ve never seen before…”
b.	Maybe intangibles are becoming tangible with technology
i.	“People wont remember what you did or what you said but will remember how you made them feel” – Maya Angelou
ii.	How you felt when you watch that player… Watching people cry when they lose…

5.	Do you ever feel torn about “hating” a player and admiring their greatness?
a.	Yes -> a potential to be better in some way, but the potential isn’t always in talent or production, it could be in being a better person/teammate, sometimes as a viewer the emotions get going out of frustration… 

7.	What influences how you feel about a player?

## Changes to implement:
-	Z.W gave a great perspective – I think something that was extremely impactful that he told me about was the Greek mythology comparison… For my final draft I will have to focus more on communicating previous mythos of historically great players, and finding ways to visualize this…
-	INTANGIBLES -> I don’t think we mentioned a single counting statistic with regards to the things that set players apart from eachother… I will have to find a way to accommodate this, and to design visualizations that rely less on quantitative data and more on communicating the “feeling” of a player… words and traits like “hustle” and “heart” come to mind…
-	We talked a decent amount about physical characteristics. This may be fun to explore, especially with historically great players like Shaq, or Yao Ming, who are household names. 
-	I will have to find a way to visualize one-time accomplishments that set Luka apart from others (triple doubles, leading a team to the playoffs… more)
o	This presents a unique challenge because they are one-offs… Most of the data visualizations I am comfortable with rely on large amounts of data and showing trends…
-	It seems like a lot of sentimental value in the historic greats
o	I really like what EV said about “what you can tell your kids about”...

### Development Plan:
#### Section 1: Explore Greatness of Athletes / Something Special
- Visualizations:
-- Steph curry shooting year
-- Shaq size
-- AI usage rate

#### Section 2: Luka Up next / SHowing Flashes
- Populate Intro and Bio
- European Player - drafting Euro Players 
- Euros in hall of fame
- Visualize physique against other players and guards
- Fix Radar Charts...
- Data wrangling for dot plots
